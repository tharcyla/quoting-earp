### Project Title
[Quoting Earp](https://twitter.com/quotingearp)

### Description
This project was actually my very first contact with Python. 

One of my favorite TV Shows of all time is [Wynonna Earp](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4878326/). After rewatching the episodes many times, I started keeping a .txt file with my favorite quotes from the episodes. 

I had seen a couple of Twitter bots that released verses from songs, such as [folklorebot](https://twitter.com/folklorebot). This gave me the idea to try and create my own bot, using the quotes I had already written down from the show. 

[Quoting Earp](https://twitter.com/quotingearp) releases a quote per hour from one of the 49 episodes of the show. The bot selects a random quote from one of the almost 600 quotes available in a json file. The bot is hosted on Heroku.

If it weren't for this passion project and for this show I love, I wouldn't have decided to study Data Science a few months later. For that, I will always be grateful. 

PS.: Since back in April 2021 I knew very little from git and the importance of writing good, descriptive commit messages, I decided to start a new git repo from scratch. From here on out, the commit messages will follow [Udacity's Commit Message Style Guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/).

### Credits
As a newbie in Python, I scoured the internet for the most basic things: installing git, installing VSCode, installing Python, and programming the bot itself.

[This article](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/making-a-quote-tweeting-twitter-bot-with-python-tweepy-and-heroku-69a11cd3f47e) by Michelle Aniuchi and her [GitHub repo](https://github.com/adamichelle/tweet-quote-bot) helped me a lot. Her bot tweeted a quote per day from the hit HBO show, [Game of Thrones](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/). 

Another article that helped me was [this](https://dev.to/emcain/how-to-set-up-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-heroku-1n39) one from Emily Cain. She created
a Twitter bot to generate fictional drug names, and then insert them in a randomly generated template.
